## Hi there 👋 nice to meet you! 

### 🦸‍♂️ About me

Hello I am Fabio and I am a Data Professional with 3+ years of experience.
### 🔭 Work

Currently, I'm working as a Machine Learning Engineer at 🧭 [Nielsen](https://www.nielsen.com/) in Lugano office (Switzerland). My primary areas of focus include:

- Applying ML and DS techniques to solve complex problems in the *Audience Measurement* industry from prototyping 👨‍🏫 the models to deploy them to production 🚀.
- Applying Software Engineering (SWE) best practices to develop common tools and libraries 🛠️ adopted by the Nielsen's data science teams 🫂.

In my previous job, I worked as a data scientist at 🔌 [Edison](https://www.edison.it/en), where I focused on upstream activities such as energy production forecasting and anomaly detection applied to power plants.


### 🆓 Free time

I recently started contributing to the open-source community. I've made some contributions to [Sklego](https://github.com/koaning/scikit-lego), and I've really enjoyed it!
